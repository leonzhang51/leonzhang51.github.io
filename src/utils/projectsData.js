          <p>Too many millennials who carry debt don't know how spend it.</p>
          <p>A survey ran by Northwestern Mutual comprised 503 Gen Zers, 672 millennials, 595 Gen Xers, and 441 baby boomers. On average, millennials who carry debt report owing to a total of $27,900 (excluding mortgages), slightly less than baby boomers and about $8,000 less than the average amount Gen Xers owe. 34% of Americans don't know how much of their monthly income goes toward paying down their personal debt.</p>
          <p><strong>Debit is a struggle even for wealthy millennials</strong></p>
          <p>Making reference to a random twitter survey and google forms. The survey had more than 1000 participants. From this survey, about 60% people don't create budgets for their spending, 50% belong to impulsively-purchasing.</p>

          <h6>Some insights from the survey:</h6>
          <ul>
            <li>It is safe to continue with the designing the solution to this issue.</li>
            <li>Users budgeting are very flexible. Some create budgets for their weekly spending. Some others create budgets for their monthly spending</li>
            <li>Those who budget do so for financial discipline and to understand how they spend their money.</li>
            <li>Some users save a portion of their income and divert the other portion to cater for their expenses.</li>
          </ul>

          <h6>Here is a list of the problems after prioritization:</h6>
          <ul>
            <li>Inability to keep track of spending.</li>

At this point and I was looking for their current features, and the overall experience using some of them. Here are some features I found related to the opportunities of the research:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>2 of the 7 apps sync bank accounts automatically;</li>
            <li>1 of the 7 reads SMS from the bank and add as a transaction â€” the person has to copy the message and add in the app;</li>

            <li>Users often struggle with deciding what to cook and what ingredients to buy</li>
            <li>Checkout processes are often lengthy and complex</li>
            <li>Limited integration between meal planning and shopping</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Popular Grocery Platforms Analyzed</h4>
