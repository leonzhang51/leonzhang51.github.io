          <h4 class="text-center">A debit-driven society (user research)</h4>
          <p>Too many millennials who carry debt don't know how spend it.</p>
          <p>
            A survey ran by Northwestern Mutual comprised 503 Gen Zers, 672
            millennials, 595 Gen Xers, and 441 baby boomers. On average,
            millennials who carry debt report owing to a total of $27,900
            (excluding mortgages), slightly less than baby boomers and about
            $8,000 less than the average amount Gen Xers owe. 34% of Americans
            don’t know how much of their monthly income goes toward paying down
            their personal debt.
          </p>
          <p>Debit is a struggle even for wealthy millennials</p>
          <p>
            Making reference to a random twitter survey and google forms. The
            survey had more than 1000 participant. From this survey, about
            60%people don’t create budgets for their spending, 50% belong to
            impulsively-purchasing.
          </p>
          <h6>Some insights from the survey:</h6>
          <ul>
            <li>
              It is safe to continue with the designing the solution to this
              issue.
            </li>
            <li>
              Users budgeting are very flexible. Some create budgets for their
              weekly spending. Some others create budgets for their monthly
              spending
            </li>
            <li>
              Those who budget do so for financial discipline and to understand
              how they spend their money.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some users save a portion of their income and divert the other
              portion to cater for their expenses.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h6>Here is a list of the problems after prioritization:</h6>
          <ul>
            <li>Inability to keep track of spending.</li>
            <li>Excessive spending on a particular expense.</li>
            <li>Lack of proper financial knowledge.</li>
            <li>Lack of access to previous financial records.</li>
            <li>Overly manual or stressful means of budgeting.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Based on data and feedback we collected we decided to state an
            hypothesis that there might be decrease irrational purchase if there
            were a better and easier way of preventing impulsive buying

          <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
          <img

            class="img-fluid"
            style="width: 100%"
            alt="Market competitor"
          />
          <p>
            I researched apps related to finances, budget and habit-building and
            I end up with 7 apps. Then I filtered the ones related to financial
            management as they could be the main competitors. At this point and
            I was looking for their current features, and the overall experience
            using some of them. Here are some features I found related to the
            opportunities of the research:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>2 of the 7 apps sync bank accounts automatically;</li>
            <li>
              1 of the 7 reads SMS from the bank and add as a transaction — the
              person has to copy the message and add in the app;
            </li>
            <li>4 of the 7 send notifications;</li>
            <li>
              7 of the 7 apps use charts to illustrate some expenses and
              transactions.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h6>Some insights from competitor analysis:</h6>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A good number of the apps favor app interaction in portrait mode.
            </li>
            <li>The apps have easily digestible financial reports.</li>
            <li>The apps all had simple and clean design.</li>
          </ul>
          <h6>Market Positioning</h6>
          <p>
            After the initial interviews and personas that I created, I set off
            to figure out the market position for the product. The goal after
            talking with everybody from users to stakeholders is the app to be
            easy to use and convenient.
          </p>
          <h6>Survey Questions</h6>
          <p>
            The purpose of these questions is to gain insight into key data and
            see if there is available information that would answer the
            questions. There was no relevant information around the topics of
            interest so I went about creating a survey to gather some real-world
            data.

          <h6>Survey results</h6>
          <p>
            I created a google form and send it out to people in our contact
            list. The survey was filled by 197 people.

          <h4 class="my-5">Empathy</h4>
          <p>
            I set off to learn about how do people actually spend— especially
            why do we have so many tools at our disposal and still people are
            terrible at spendings. 100% of the users are real people, focused on
            the mindset they shared with me I created two separate user personas
            based on my assumptions after the interviews.

          <p>
            We usually start the design process with low fidelity sketches. In
            this time, we started to test the demo site searching for pain
            points. After we analysed what users got confused from, we took
            these insights and made some sketches on paper. Later, we propose UI
            by Look & Feel pages. When our client chose the preferred one, we
            started to built up the high fidelity prototype using Sketch. We
            iterated after every user test and that is how we got our final
            desktop screens. The last part was to interpret bigger screens into
            smaller phone screens.

              <p>
                Hey [name]. thanks for taking the time. I was telling you about
                the app I am working on, and now would need to test a prototype
                with you, it shouldn't take more than 15–30 minutes of your
                time. I’ll ask you to complete just three tasks and that’s all
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  You have received $890 in cash instead of in your bank
                  account. You need to add it into your money to be budgeted,
                  how would you do that?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Let’s say we need that money to be added to category RENT.
                  Let’s add $500 and $90 to electricity. The rest $300 you add
                  to Groceries. How would you do that?
                </li>
                <li>
                  The last one is very simple. You have overspent on a category
                  called Eating out. How would you move $57 from Rent to Earing
                  out?
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Thank you very much! You really helped me a lot! It is important
                for me to receive feedback early on and to try to validate my
                assumptions.

            operate with their money and plan accordingly. I was excited about
            this idea so a reality check was much needed.

                  All participants managed to add the money to be budgeted.

                  Around half of the users got a little bit stuck about
                  converting money from one category to another.

          <h4 class="my-5">Final UI which I did</h4>
          <p>
            I tried to focus on features related to solving some of the major
            desired outcomes found in the initial research. The app should be
            simple and easy to understand. Also, encouraging them to build
            financial habits. Here are the highlighted features:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Link Accounts</li>
            <li>
              Ease of adding accounts to give you a clear overview right away
            </li>
            <li>
              The ease of adding a bank account and credit card is vital for the
              success of this product. If somehow your bank doesn’t allow to
              login and gets statements you can always add your finances
              manually on a later stage.
            </li>
          </ul>

              <p>Monthly Contribution</p>
              <p>Target Balance</p>
              <p>
                The purpose of this is to achieve goals easier. By setting goals
                with a monthly contribution you will have an automatic payment
                to that “bucket” every single month. When you set the payment to
                Target Balance it’s free, however, you can set deadlines by
                which date you want to achieve that.

          </div>
          <h6 class="mt-5">Payment method</h6>
          <p>
            If the payment over the limit which set in security setting, system
            will send approval request to your accountguard, the app will
            continue payment process if you have approval code, why we add
            barrier in the process, because we hope user can stop and thinking,
            then to avoid impulsively-purchasing.

          <h4 class="my-5">Main learnings</h4>
          <p>
            Know your audience – Paying and giving credit card details makes
            users suspicious. Even under safe conditions, sometimes a bunch of
            lock icons (🔒) really helps make them truly believe you. :) Also,
            copy factors very highly here, which takes us to the next point.
          </p>
          <p>
            …and how to talk to them (Improve your writing skills) – As
            mentioned, copywriting makes up an important element of UX. We need
            to improve not just the visual but the written communication skills
            too.
