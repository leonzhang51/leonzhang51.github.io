                <h2>1.Context</h2>
                <h4>1.1 Introduction</h4>
                <p>City parking is a mobile APP dedicate to solve parking problem in the city, it brings a lot of
                    convenience to the driver, like car location info, parking lot info, snow removal notice.
                </p>
                <h4>1.2 Ideation</h4>
                <p>The idea was generated in a winter night when I came back home, I saw some vehicle towed before snow
                    removal action, I thought the owner of vehicle should be informed by some system, like telephone,
                    SMS or notification on the phone to avoid tickets, then I do research on the internet to look for a
                    solution, but I am not finding any solution for this.</p>
                <p>I also notice the parking in the city is a big popular pain for any driver when I do research on the
                    internet, I ask myself whether I can find a solution for this, the answer is "I want to try". The
                    first important thing is where I can get public parking information, snow removal information etc.,
                    I checked the website of government, I found a lot of city have open data service, I can access
                    parking information, towed vehicle info etc. in database, then I try to validate idea in one mobile
                    app Meetup of Montreal, I got a lot of useful response in that meetup.</p>
                <h4>1.3 Most common responses from meetup:</h4>

                <h2>5. Research</h2>
                <h4>5.1 Product Audit</h4>
                <p>Before brainstorming solutions, I wanted to explore the product to understand it deeper and see if
                    there were other UI/UX issues. Later, I’ll mention some issues that I discovered in the “Define”
                    section.
                </p>
                <h4>5.2 Competitive Analysis</h4>
                <p>I started by looking at other app which can provide parking info for driver in montreal which used
                    open API provided by city government on mobile to identify what seemed to work and what did not.</p>
                <p>During this research I noticed no APPs can provide function following :</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="ml-5"><b>Search parking lot:</b> Help driver to find parking lot in daily life.
                    </li>
                    <li class="ml-5"><b>Provide timer for parking except public paid parking:</b> provide detail timer
                        function for
                        public free parking or paid parking, like when the city conducts its street maintenance,cleans
                        the roads and snow removal, you have to move your vehicle.
                    </li>
                    <li class="ml-5"><b>Provide detailed information for car location:</b> provide car detail
                        information of
                        location, like car towed by some towed service provider, especially in snow removal period.
                    </li>

                <p>As our schedule, we will meet together once a week to discus our project. I would present my design
                    concepts and receive design critiques from others</p>
                <h4>7.2 Lesson Learned</h4>
                <p>When presenting design work, come into meetings ready to learn with an open mind. Confidently present
                    your designs, but humbly take feedback. Oftentimes there a new perspectives and considerations that
                    others will share with you.</p>
                <p><b>Here is some of the feedback I received from the team:</b></p>

                <p>Concentrate core issues: The core problem of clients is parking(where and how long).

                <h2>10. Retrospective</h2>
                <h4>10.1 What I'd do differently?</h4>
                <p>Looking back on this project, I would have:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="ml-5">Concentrate on the core problem of clients,don’t add unnecessary function as your
                        imagine which
                        not validated by client </li>
                    <li class="ml-5">Taken more initiative to ensure research was happening throughout the project.</li>
                    <li class="ml-5">Questioned the problems that the client presented to us so that I know they are
                        really problems
                        that need to be solved.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>10.2 Outcome</h4>
                <p>After I finished design this project, I achieve the goal what I set at the begining, but I can not
                    find any partner or
                    team to make this design reality, for technical issues or finance issues I can not confirm, I have
                    to collect all the document and put it in my backup harddrive.</p>
                <h4>10.3 Lesson learned:</h4>
                <p>During this project, I learned:</p>
                <li class="ml-5">You have to take the initiative and do the research yourself.</li>
                <li class="ml-5">Pay attention constraints and roadblocks when you design the product because UX
                    research does not
                    always follow the perfect route.</li>
                <li class="ml-5">To be a good listener, go out to present your design, do not always stay in your UX
                    island alone
                </li>
                <li class="ml-5">To be quatified product designer, you have to have more knowledge, like how to make
                    this design to
                    be a real mobile APP, how this app make profit</li>
