            <p>The sireta service center is a utility app meant to order common services like house cleaning,dry
                cleaning, plumbing etc as simple as several clicks, all our stress and hassle free order process like
                ordering a Pizza.</p>

                <h2>Context</h2>
                <p>Customers have always been demanding the best from their providers. The one that can satisfy every
                    wish of the customer and ready to go the extra mile will survive any competition. This trend has
                    been in existence since the dawn of trading and business, and the present version of this trend is
                    On-Demand Services. </p>
                <p>Sireta on demand service started as an internal project at Sireta Montreal,the purpose of this
                    project is to help business member of Chefaid, which became a standalone product, helping Chefaide
                    acquire and retain business member. We wanted to delight service booking experience for finding
                    affordable, credible, reliable service in cities like Montreal, Toronto, New York. Sireta on demand
                    service will be scaled to more cities after this business model approved in Montreal.</p>

                <h2>Pain:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Service provider: Hard to connect more customer</li>
                    <li>Customer: Hard to obtain satisfied service with reasonable price</li>
                </ul>

                <p>They are basically a similar idea but maidinmontreal.ca concentrate in house cleaning service,
                    jiffyondemand.com only provide home repair service in Toronto and Ottawa. They are not our direct
                    competitor in Montreal. </p>
                <p>
                    After analyzed information ,I found Sireta on-demand service can do better than 2 website above, it
                    can provide more service on our website. Sireta on-demand service provides a new platform for
                    service provider and user, any person can provide service when he wants(like tutoring, home service,
                    car service, dry clean etc), user can choose service provider based on distance, review, price,
                    schedule and set condition as he wants. All the stress and hassle free process like use Uber.

                    but as these services become more mature, their consumers are becoming more like the general
                    population. Specifically:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>48% are under age 35</li>

                <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" style="height:30vh;" src="../img/ondemand/">
                <p>
                    To be sure we're addressing the right problems we designed our process around regular cycles of
                    prototyping and face to face user sessions, validating every step of the way with the input from
                    real users. Our starting point was observed the process of how the client order service as usual.

                </p>
                <p>
                    In our user interviews, in order to find home service, 70% of people would use internet search for
                    service provider, 20% of people use friend’s referral, the other check information on paper yellow
                    pages, newspaper etc.

                </p>
                <p>
                    As the research result, we plan to build a mvp( Minimum viable product ) at an early stage, help we
                    iron out problems and gain feedback for future iterations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this product we set up our app’s architecture based on the two main use-cases: ‘user looking for
                    service that I want to get’ or ‘service provider list the service what he want to provide’.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Focusing on the utility of finding service, we decided to strip the service and provider information
                    to the essentials, maximizing the rest of the space for the services' list.

                <h2>Outcome</h2>
                <p>The app was well received within the company. While it has not yet been released, it has already
                    increased communication within the company by becoming a rallying point for strengthening internal
                    community. Another by-product of this project was that it initialized the new mobile product design
                    and development process within the company that ultimately helped it to take on new mobile projects
                    which it wasn't able to before.</p>

                <p> As a result of this experience, I learned that when designing a product for a new environment,
                    bringing in the engineering team early on in the project really helps things to go smoothly down the
                    line.
