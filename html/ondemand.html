                <h3>Context</h3>
                <h4>App introduction</h4>

                <p>The sireta service center is a utility app meant to order common services like house cleaning,dry
                    cleaning, plumbing etc as simple as several clicks, all our stress and hassle free order process
                    like
                    ordering a Pizza.</p>

                <h4>Problem statement</h4>
                <p>Customers have always been demanding the best from their providers. The one that can satisfy every
                    wish of the customer and ready to go the extra mile will survive any competition. This trend has
                    been in existence since the dawn of trading and business, and the present version of this trend is
                    On-Demand Services. </p>
                <h4>Project context</h4>
                <p>Sireta on demand service started as an internal project at Sireta Montreal,the purpose of this
                    project is to help business member of Chefaid, which became a standalone product, helping Chefaide
                    acquire and retain business member. We wanted to delight service booking experience for finding
                    affordable, credible, reliable service in cities like Montreal, Toronto, New York. Sireta on demand
                    service will be scaled to more cities after this business model approved in Montreal.</p>

                </div>
                <p>They are basically a similar idea but maidinmontreal.ca concentrate in house cleaning service,
                    jiffyondemand.com only provide home repair service in Toronto and Ottawa. They are not our direct
                    competitor in Montreal. </p>
                <p>
                    After analyzed information ,I found Sireta on-demand service can do better than 2 website above, it
                    can provide more service on our website. Sireta on-demand service provides a new platform for
                    service provider and user, any person can provide service when he wants(like tutoring, home service,
                    car service, dry clean etc), user can choose service provider based on distance, review, price,
                    schedule and set condition as he wants. All the stress and hassle free process like use Uber.

                </p>

                <h4>Users and audience</h4>

                <p>On-demand economy consumers tend to be younger, more educated, and more concentrated in urban areas,
                    but as these services become more mature, their consumers are becoming more like the general
                    population. Specifically:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="ml-5">48% are under age 35</li>
                    <li class="ml-5">52% are female</li>
                    <li class="ml-5">43% have a four year college degree or higher</li>
                    <li class="ml-5">51% live in a suburb and 14% live in an inner city</li>
                    <li class="ml-5">53% report an annual household income of at least $50,000, while 36% report an
                        annual household
                        income of at least $75,000</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The target users of our product are professionals working in the city. These users have a strong
                    preference for mobile-first, fast, real-time communication.We will consider design a friendly
                    interface for female</p>
                <h4>personas</h4>
                <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" style="height:30vh;" src="../img/ondemand/personas.jpg">
                <p>
                    To be sure we're addressing the right problems we designed our process around regular cycles of
                    prototyping and face to face user sessions, validating every step of the way with the input from
                    real users. Our starting point was observed the process of how the client order service as usual.

                </p>
                <p>
                    In our user interviews, in order to find home service, 70% of people would use internet search for
                    service provider, 20% of people use friend’s referral, the other check information on paper yellow
                    pages, newspaper etc.

                </p>
                <p>
                    As the research result, we plan to build a mvp( Minimum viable product ) at an early stage, help we
                    iron out problems and gain feedback for future iterations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this product we set up our app’s architecture based on the two main use-cases: ‘user looking for
                    service that I want to get’ or ‘service provider list the service what he want to provide’.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Focusing on the utility of finding service, we decided to strip the service and provider information
                    to the essentials, maximizing the rest of the space for the services' list.
                </p>
                <h4>Pain:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li class="ml-5">Service provider: Hard to connect more customer</li>
                    <li class="ml-5">Customer: Hard to obtain satisfied service with reasonable price</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>User journal (customer)</h4>

                <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" style="height:30vh;" src="../img/ondemand/userflow_service.png">
                <p>Based on the user flows, we constructed the information architecture such that there was a minimal
                    level of difficulty to immediately accessing relevant information. After all, the goal of this
                    product is to enable users to quickly and easily consume information.</p>

                <h2>Design</h2>
                <h4>Design Goal</h4>
                <p>Create a platform offering person to sell their service to users instead of paying unreasonable rate
                    for what they got.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="ml-5">
                        Every good service provider can make more money
                    </li>
                    <li class="ml-5">

                        Every user only pay for the service what he got and wanted

            <section>
                <h4>Challenge</h4>
                <p>As a location based service for locals only find a way to provide accessibility for users to find
                    service they want, and to deliver quality service on time. (<b>right service, right time, right
                        place and right price</b>).
                </p>
                <p>The big challenge for design is we using lean design process for this project, we work with
                    develpment and marketing team closely, we have to continuous change design as feedback.</p>
                <p>The other challenge for our team is we have another project in development at same time.</p>

                            The service provider can approve or deny the client's request when he got in the
                            notification after he accepts and begin to work, he can track and modify service status, he
                            can send the invoice to the client after everything is finished, the service provider also
                            can do the ranking for the client at the end of service.

                <h4>Outcome</h4>
                <p>This App in development now, all of our business partners satisfy our design and hope they can use
                    our final product as soon as possible.</p>
                <h4>Lessons</h4>
                <p> Design 2 projects at the same time is a challenge for me, I have to plan the schedule for 2
                    projects, make a daily and weekly task list and adjust them by development process.
                </p>
                <p> Identify the useful feedback, not all the feedbacks are useful for design, I try to respect all the
                    feedback and use them in my design at the beginning stage, it cause I waste a lot of time on useless
                    design. </p>
