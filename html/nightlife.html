        <section>
            <h3>Context</h3>
            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>"Nightlife Ville" is a simple utility app meant to make plan nightlife as simple as
                hailing a Uber</p>
            <h4>Problem statement and first action</h4>
            <p>When I was single, I’m always feel confused about what I can eat and where I can go for fun based on my
                budget, because I want to control my spending, so I have to set a budget for my nightlife. This is my
                own problem or the popular problem? As a designer I am always observe the problem around me and try to
                find a solution or ansIr for it, so I begin to conduct user research for this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="ml-5">The first I designed a very simple questionnaire sent to my colleague, friends,
                    classmates then
                    collect feedback from them.
                    Do you need an APP to provide solution for your nightlife based on your budget?
                </li>
                <li class="ml-5">
                    The second I conduct surveys on the road with the strangers.
                </li>
                <li class="ml-5">
                    Third conduct research on the internet to check the website or app who can provide similar service.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As the feedback collected and results of research on the internet, 85% of feedback shown they like this
                idea and result of research on the internet shown no website or mobile app can provide service what I
                want. Based on this result, I make a decision I want to try it.
            </p>

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <h4>User & Audience</h4>
            <p>The target clients of nightlife ville are young persons who have strong preference for mobile-first. </p>
            <p>They are heavy users of internet and mobile, so they want something that feel familiar to those
                experience, but more focus on mobile.</p>


            <h4>User research</h4>
            <p>Keeping my personas in mind, I wanted to capture the full user journey from researching through the
                physical visit to the place where they planned.</p>
            <p class="text-center">Personas</p>
            <img src="../img/nightlife/personas.jpg" class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" style="width: 20vw;">

            <h4>First hand observation</h4>
            <p>
                I conducted interviews with focus groups and observed the person how they search restaurant, pub or
                some place for leisure to gain their perspective on the user's experience . 90% of user using yelp.ca,
                mtlblog.com, social network to confirm their nightlife itinerary. The others using google. I noticed all
                the process will be stressful and boring for them. I also check research report and do some surveys on
                internet for address user behavior and attitudes.
            </p>
            <h4>The primary pain points are:</h4>

            <li class="ml-5">All the website can not provide clear and direct information for target place. The user has
                to use
                different website and app to do research .</li>
            <li class="ml-5">User has plan itinerary by themselves, or using some planner app to record all itinerary of
                nightlife.</li>
            <li class="ml-5">User doesn't know exactly amount they will spend on this itinerary.</li>
            <li class="ml-5">User hard to find out some other new and interesting places.</li>
            <li class="ml-5">User has to waste time on boring research.</li>
            </li>

            <h4>
                Competitive analysis
            </h4>
            <p>No website and mobile APP can provide similar service as I planned</p>

            <h3>Design</h3>
            <h4>Design goal and challenges</h4>
            <h5>Design goal</h5>
            <p>The nightlife ville is dedicated to helping user extricate from complicated and boring nightlife planning
                job.The goal of design is making this process be interesting, be fun, be simple,don’t be boring, like
                playing games.</p>
            <h5>Challenges</h5>
            <p>Finished all the design in 4 weeks, because this is a passion project, I worked it on my spare time, I
                have to finished research, analysis,design job in limited time.</p>

            <h4>Design process</h4>
            <p>This is a passion project means I don't have any business resource, I have to do everything by myself and
                work it on my spare time.</p>
            <h5>Site mapping</h5>
            <p>Fow now I have a comprehensive list of necessary, prioritized features for the new site, I mapped out
                the
                overall site structure. This helped me to narrow down the right navigation choices and which pages
                would
                be created.</p>
            <img src="../img/nightlife/sitemap.jpg" class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" style="width: 40vw;">
            <h5 class="text-center py-5"><b>Userflow</b></h5>
            <img src="../img/nightlife/userflow.jpg" class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" style="width: 40vw;">


            <h5 class="py-5">Wireframe -> test -> repeat</h5>
            <p><b>Low fidelity wireframes</b></p>
            <p>The low fidelity wireframe used to convey meaning to the user or product owner, that’s very important
                to
                present and evaluate my idea. The biggest challenges in wireframing are conceptualizing a trouble
                free
                tools for nightlife planning. </p>
            <img src="../img/nightlife/low_fidelity.jpg" class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" style="width: 40vw;">
            <p><b>Test and repeat</b></p>
            <p>In testing, I was very concerned with finding out if my concepts for the nightlife planning, and the
                process of the nightlife planning was easy to understand. In testing with users and getting feedback
                from other designers, I gathered pages of necessary changes that would help users accomplish their
                tasks. I also learned that the planning process needs to be optimised and the number of budget
                unnecessary shows everywhere.</p>
            <p>After redesign planning process and remove some budget tag in planning pages, I tested the new
                designs on
                users again, and felt confident moving forward. The structure was usable, logical, and familiar.</p>

            <h2>Final Design</h2>
            <p>
                The nightlife ville is dedicated to helping user extricate from complicated nightlife planning
                job.The
                nightlife ville will change this experience be interesting, be fun, don’t be boring, like playing
                games
                on your smartphone.
                From my research speaking with designer,sales person and potential user, I learned the user only
                need a
                beautiful,simple and useful tools to help them plan their nightlife.

            </p>
            <p>
                For these reasons, Colors should be vibrant, content should be directed.I will use animation following
                to present what I design for the user.
